<p>We have only just met, but I think this is the start of something beautiful. Whenever I say Hello World, you never fail to say it back. I never have to worry about where we are in our relationship because I can check with ls and pwd. If I think that we need to take a step back I can cd .. to bring us back to where we once were. I love that we can create a new folder for our life's every time I use mkdir. When we touch we create new memories in the form of files. Thank you for always confirming what I have to say by repeating it back to me. If we get in a fight I know we can clear away all the mistakes and start over. I can always count on you to help me move stuff around by using mv. </p>
