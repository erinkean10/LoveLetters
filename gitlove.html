        <p style="background-color:lightpink;" class="Sparkle"> We initiate our conversations without any argument. We have only spent a few weeks together, but I know this relationship will last. I can always check the status of our relationship without any hesitation and you will tell me exactly where we are at. Adding to our relationship is effortless and you somehow always remember what I said when I commit a message to you. I love how you are willing to go down a different branch to try new things with me. If we love the branch we choose, it is never an issue to merge this new branch with our current branch by using git merge.  </div> </p>
