            <p>GitHub, <br>We decided to make our relationship public when I created an account. It was so easy. When I decided to add a new repository, everything changed. Now that we have gone public with our code, not only are we able to show others what we have done, but we can learn from the people around us to get relationship advice. I can put my trust in you because you always back up my work. It is easy for you to remember what files have been changed when I add them through git push origin. You are able to handle so many branches of my thoughts until I can make my mind up on what I want to do. It is super easy to tell my friends about the changes in our relationship just by doing a pull request. Everyone is always happy with the changes so we always end our conversations by merging the pull request. I can't wait to spend more time with you to learn all of your secrets.  </p>
